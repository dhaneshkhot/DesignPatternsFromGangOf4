1. Used when tye of object to create is determined by prototypical instance which is cloned to produce --
-- a new instance
2. Often to get a unique instance of the same object
3. To avoid costly creation, subclassing (usually instance of prototype is created)
4. Typically dont use the keyword 'new', only first instance is created by 'new' keyword --
-- after than they are cloned
5. Utilizes interface
6. Usually implemented with registry i.e. object is created and kept in registry and when needed cloned from
7. Shallow copy vs Deep Copy
    Shallow copy:
        Copied the references and kind of risky if modified as changes will be there for both objects.

    Deep copy:
        Copied to new variables with same values in the object
