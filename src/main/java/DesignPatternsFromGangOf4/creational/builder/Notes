1. Great for constructing objects that contain lot of parameters
2. Useful when object needs to be mutable once construction is finished
3. Helps to determine what constructor to use
4. Creation of multiple constructor with each parameter variation called 'telescoping constructor'.
Builder pattern helps overcome this creation by handling constrution objects rather than parameters.
5. Typically written with static inner class (can be separate class) as it returns instance of object that it is building.


** StudentBean and StudentBeanTelescoping are just examples of how things could have been done--
-- without builder. In both the cases object is immutable once created
